  "articleBody": "Chapters Introduction Theory behind this Hijacking a Thread Conclusion Introduction So, in this short blog - we’ll be discussing how you could restrict the creation of threads to a certain extent by using a simple trick. As we know, all thread creation, essentially, goes through NtCreateThread. This means when you invoke; CreateThread, CreateRemoteThread, etc, you’re going through NtCreateThread behind the scenes. This makes it easy for us, who want to prevent people from creating threads because we don’t have to worry about doing this trick on multiple functions. This goes hand in hand with having whitelisted areas where you should be able to create your threads but you should do this under situations where you’re confident because if someone malicious finds out where you’re creating your legitimate threads, what stops them from creating their threads there too?\nTheory behind this Okay so now that we’ve spoken a little on how it works, let’s talk about exactly what we’ll be doing. Since all threads created go through NtCreateThread what we’ll be doing is placing a debug breakpoint within NtCreateThread at the start of the application. This means anyone trying to create a thread before we have even started up will get caught in our custom VEH Handler as trying to create a thread will throw EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT. Once in our VEH Handler, we have full power over the user. We can start by checking the RIP and if it points to an illegitimate module or area of memory where nobody should be calling CreateThread from we can safely denounce that this is a malicious user as all our thread calls would be from areas of memory that we call whitelisted areas.\nHijacking a Thread After all this, the malicious user might think instead of creating a thread - let’s hijack one. This is no better for them, while we can’t exactly use our NtCreateThread method here - we can incorporate a new one. We can stack walk the list of addresses that the thread has gone through, if one of the addresses suddenly seems out of place we can subject it to the same theory of our VEH Handler, check the RIP, and see if it comes from an illegitimate module by a numerous amounts of checks on the actual allocation itself as well as the typical whitelisted area check.\nConclusion In conclusion, this was a really short blog detailing a method that can potentially be used and paired well with other anti-cheat technology to safely stop any vulnerabilities in creating threads. It’s not a typical method for cheaters to create threads but if they’re faced with the possibility of doing so without being caught, they most likely will. A lot of them go with the second option of hijacking a thread or maybe even hooking but both are just as detectable as the other.\n",
